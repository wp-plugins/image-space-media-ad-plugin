== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What does Image Space Media (ISM) do? =

Image Space Media is the leading provider of in-image advertising for the Internet. Image Space Media gives publishers a steady revenue stream for their image space without competing with other revenue sources.  

= What is In-Image Advertising? =

In-image advertising is an overlay technology that matches relevant ads with images across the Internet.  

= What does ISM In-Image Advertising offer that other online formats don't? =
* Unobtrusive — the transparent ads are user-initiated and only appear when your reader mouses over an image.
* Our technology maximizes ad space on existing web pages without compromising your priceless content. 
* Impact — combines relevancy of the brand association with an evocative visual experience.

* Easy to install — just one snippet of JavaScript or simple WordPress widget.
* Our sophisticated keyword matching is based on your metadata and page data to ensure all ads are targeted and relevant.
* Doesn’t conflict with other revenue sources.


= How does Image Space Media's technology work? = 
It’s simple. You install a snippet of our code via our Wordpress plugin in your pages and our system matches relevant ads with your images based on your metadata. 

= Are there minimum or non-standard sizes? = 
At this time we don’t advertise on IAB standard unit sizes (images that are 300x250, banners, skyscrapers). There is a format requirement of at least 200px by 100px.  

= Does ISM's technology interfere with my already existing ads? =

Image Space Media in-image advertising works alongside all other revenue sources including Google Adsense, Doubleclick, Adbrite, Kontera, etc.  

= Where do I register for an account? =

Register right here: www.imagespacemedia.com/publishers/register.
If you meet our criteria, you’ll be approved within 24 hours.  

= My publisher account was approved, but ads still are not showing up. Why? = 
Don't worry, there could be a few reasons. Here are the possible reasons.  
1. Have you setup a domain yet? If not, make sure you have logged in to pub-stop and setup your domain account. 
2. If your domain is a recent setup, it needs to be reviewed by ISM for adherence to content guidelines. Hold on, this process is relatively quick and should be ready in a matter of hours. 
3. Double check your plugin status. Make sure the ISM plugin is set to active. 
4. OK, problem still not solved? You can still get help. Contact us at feedback@imagespacemedia.com and we'll get right back to you. 

= Does the in-image ad change the properties of my image? = 
No way! In-image advertising is strictly an overlay. We won’t alter your image properties or conflict with copyright laws. The transparent overlay is user-initiated and appears on the lower or upper fourth of an image.  

= Can I control which images contain ads? = 
Of course! Our technology identifies images on your site, including ads, logos and thumbnails and eliminates them from the ad overlay application. You can control which images have ads with the Image Manager in pub-stop.  

= How do I get paid? = 
Unlike other ad networks that distribute payments every 60-90 days, Image Space Media pays our publishers during the first week of each month for your previous months earnings. You can elect payment via US Mail or PayPal once a $25 minimum payout is reached. Set up your payment method selection when you register. You can change this selection anytime through the Account Settings tab in pub-stop.
